                        Minecraft is a 2011 sandbox game developed and published by Mojang Studios.
                        Originally created by Markus "Notch" Persson using the Java programming language, it was developed over the span of two years, with many public test builds being released from May 2009 until its full release on 18 November 2011.
                        After the game's full release, Persson gave Jens "Jeb" Bergensten control over the game's development.
                        In the years since its release, it has been ported to several platforms, including smartphones and various video game consoles, primarily by 4J Studios
                        In 2014, Mojang and the Minecraft intellectual property were purchased by Microsoft for US$2.5 billion.
                        Minecraft has become the best-selling video game of all-time, with over 300 million copies sold and nearly 140 million monthly active players as of 2023.

                        Minecraft is a 3D sandbox video game that has no required goals to accomplish, allowing players a large amount of freedom in choosing how to play the game.
                        The game also features an optional achievement system.
                        Gameplay is in the first-person perspective by default, but players have the option of a third-person perspective.
                        The game world is composed of rough 3D objects—mainly cubes and fluids, commonly referred to as "blocks"—representing various materials, such as dirt, stone, ores, tree trunks, water, and lava.
                        The core gameplay revolves around picking up and placing these objects.
                        These blocks are arranged in a 3D grid, while players can move freely around the world.
                        Players can "mine" blocks and then place them elsewhere, enabling them to build things.
                        The game also contains a material called redstone, which can be used to make primitive mechanical devices, electrical circuits, and logic gates, allowing for the construction of many complex systems.
                        Many commentators have described the game's physics system as unrealistic.
