                    There were no subsequent minor versions to 1.1.
                    It was the first version to be released under Jens Bergensten as the lead creative developer of Minecraft.

                    It also adds ender chests, improved enchanting and splits the Creative inventory into separate sections.
                    This is the first version to use an internal multiplayer server in singleplayer worlds.
                    Initially Mojang were going to add rubies, but replaced those with emeralds.
                    While it was not the only 1.3 release, it was the only one before the snapshots of 1.4.2 started.

                    The Combat Update is the name for Java Edition 1.9, a major update released on February 29, 2016.
                    This update overhauled the combat system, among other additions and changes.
                    The official name for the update, the Combat Update, was discovered on April 1, 2015, by Reddit user 3dDeters (and several others independently) who found a QR code hidden in the snow falling pattern of the April Fools 15w14a snapshot.
                    The development team called the release feature-complete by the end of October 2015, although the update was pushed to 2016 as the developers "want to fix more bugs before release, and keep the game stable over the holidays".

                    The Update Aquatic is the name for a major update that was released for most versions of Minecraft in 2018, with the exception of the Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and New Nintendo 3DS editions.
                    The Update Aquatic focuses on revamping the oceans in Minecraft, adding many new aquatic mobs, blocks, items and structures.
                    The update marks the advent of the trend of major themed content updates being released across certain editions relatively simultaneously, rather than across differently-titled, unrelated-sounding updates per edition.

                    1.17, the first release of Caves & Cliffs: Part I, is a major update to Java Edition announced at Minecraft Live 2020 and released on June 8, 2021.
                    On April 14, 2021, Mojang Studios announced that the update would be split into two updates due to the amount and complexity of content, as well as team health.
                    Multiple features such as revamped mountain and cave generation, the lush caves and dripstone caves biomes, and increased world height were removed in 21w15a, and were subsequently released in 1.18.
                    A data pack was included in the Minecraft.net article for 21w15a that re-enabled the removed features, and subsequent snapshots updated this data pack.
